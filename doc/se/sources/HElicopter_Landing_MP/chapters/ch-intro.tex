The very first target was to adapt a new hardware (Raspberry Pi) including a autonomous landing to the Quadrocopter from Hochschule Esslingen (HElikopter). As this was not enough work for all of us, the project was extended to include a autonomous landing, too. We were a team of 4 students who were interested in a project work with the HElikopter. We internally agreed in splitting the work in 2 parts. The other two students were more interested in developing the new hardware platform and software and we liked to care about the autonomous landing.

As we developed the autonomous landing to the new hardware, there was a slight dependence to each other.
