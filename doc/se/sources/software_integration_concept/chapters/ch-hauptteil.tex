\section{Requirements for current Raspberry Pi implementation}
\label{sec:feasibility:reqRasp}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Highly abstracted
	\item Highly modularized
	\item Statespace representation
\end{itemize}

\section{Findings on current code branch}
\label{sec:feasibility:fingings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only partly abstracted
	\item Modularized but with strong dependency on hardware
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:feasibility:conclusion}
Workload for merging both branches leads to high workload, high inter-dependencies, low readability of code.

Due to the past difficulties during the workload balance of the current project team, it is not recommended to merge both branches of software.

This could be part of a separate project in future. An harmonization of the control software would be a huge benefit, but it has to be designed carefully and without hurry and time pressure to ensure good quality and flexibility!
